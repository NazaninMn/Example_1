# Reproducible Research

Reproducibility is the closeness of the agreement between the results of measurements of the same measurand carried out with same methodology described in the corresponding scientific evidence (e.g. a publication in a peer-reviewed journal)[@mcculloughLessonsJMCBArchive2006a]. Reproducibility can also be applied under changed conditions of measurement for the same measurandâ€”to check that the results are not an artefact of the measurement procedures.[@curtis.supleenist.govNISTTechnicalNote2009a]
A related concept is replication, which is the ability to independently achieve non-identical conclusions that are at least similar, when differences in sampling, research procedures and data analysis methods may exist.[@leekOpinionReproducibleResearch2015]
